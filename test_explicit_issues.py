IMPORTANT: Look carefully for these specific issues that are common in Excel Web:

1. **Color Issues:**
   - Button colors that don't match the design system
   - Text that might have poor contrast
   - Hover states that look wrong

2. **Spacing Issues:**
   - Uneven spacing between elements
   - Padding that looks too tight or too loose
   - Inconsistent gaps between buttons or icons

3. **Typography Issues:**
   - Text that looks too small or too large
   - Font weights that seem inconsistent
   - Line spacing that looks cramped

4. **Alignment Issues:**
   - Elements that don't line up properly
   - Buttons that seem misaligned
   - Icons that don't align with text

5. **Component Issues:**
   - Border radius that looks wrong
   - Shadows that seem too strong or too weak
   - Dialog positioning that looks off

6. **Layout Issues:**
   - Dialog boxes that might be too close to edges
   - Panels that don't seem properly centered
   - Elements that look cramped or too spread out

Analyze the provided screenshots and report ANY visual issues you can spot, even if they seem minor.

Format your response as:
CRAFT BUG #1
Type: [Color|Spacing|Typography|Alignment|Component|Layout]
Severity: [Red|Orange|Yellow]
Title: [Brief description]
Description: [What looks wrong]
Expected: [What should look like]
Actual: [What currently looks like]

If you find ANY issues, report them. Only say "No visible craft bugs detected" if you are absolutely certain there are no visual issues at all.

Screenshots to analyze:
- Step 1: Excel initial state
- Step 2: Copilot dialog  
- Step 3: Save dialog"""
