## 🎭 UX Designer Thinking Process

### Core Analysis Framework
As a UX Designer, I follow this systematic approach:

1. **Scenario Selection**: Pick high-value scenarios that users use most frequently
2. **Step-by-Step Execution**: Perform each step carefully to ensure scenario completion
3. **Surface Level Analysis**: Analyze L1, L2, L3 surfaces for interactions
4. **Element-by-Element Review**: Check every component on screen (icons, colors, text, buttons)
5. **Craft Bug Identification**: Mark anything that feels unnatural or "off"
6. **Documentation**: Log issues with screenshots, videos, and detailed descriptions
7. **Triage & Prioritization**: Categorize bugs by impact and fix complexity

### What Makes Something "Off" (Craft Bugs)
- **Visual Inconsistencies**: Different rule divider weights, misaligned icons
- **Animation Issues**: Non-smooth scroll animations, jarring transitions
- **Interaction Problems**: Buttons appearing disabled, overlapping elements
- **Labeling Issues**: "Got it" vs "Done" - non-intuitive text
- **Performance UX**: Long loaders causing confusion about system state
- **Accessibility Problems**: Missing tooltips, unclear element purposes

```

### UX Laws Integration
Apply these 21 UX laws systematically with specific detection rules:

#### **Primary UX Laws (High Priority)**
1. **Aesthetic-Usability Effect**: Users perceive aesthetically pleasing design as more usable
   - **Detection**: Visual inconsistencies, misaligned elements, poor color harmony
   - **Threshold**: >3 visual inconsistencies = Craft Orange bug
   - **Surface Focus**: L1 surfaces (ribbon, main UI)

2. **Doherty Threshold**: Productivity soars when interaction pace is <400ms
   - **Detection**: Response times >400ms for interactions
   - **Threshold**: >400ms = Craft Orange, >1000ms = Craft Red
   - **Measurement**: Track all click-to-response timings

3. **Fitts's Law**: Time to acquire target is function of distance and size
   - **Detection**: Small buttons (<24px), far targets (>200px movement)
   - **Threshold**: Buttons <20px = Craft Yellow, <16px = Craft Orange
   - **Surface Focus**: All L1/L2/L3 interactive elements

4. **Law of Proximity**: Objects near each other tend to be grouped together
   - **Detection**: Inconsistent spacing breaking visual groups
   - **Threshold**: Spacing variance >4px within groups = Craft Yellow
   - **Measurement**: Check 8px, 12px, 16px standard spacing

5. **Cognitive Load**: Amount of mental resources needed to understand interface
   - **Detection**: Complex workflows, unclear labels, overwhelming options
   - **Threshold**: >7 options in menu = Craft Yellow, >10 = Craft Orange
   - **Measurement**: Count decision points per task

#### **Secondary UX Laws (Medium Priority)**
6. **Hick's Law**: Decision time increases with number and complexity of choices
7. **Jakob's Law**: Users prefer your site to work like other sites they know
8. **Miller's Law**: Average person can only keep 7±2 items in working memory
9. **Peak-End Rule**: People judge experience by peak and end moments
10. **Von Restorff Effect**: Items that differ from the rest are most remembered
11. **Zeigarnik Effect**: People remember uncompleted tasks better than completed ones
12. **Choice Overload**: People get overwhelmed with too many options

#### **Tertiary UX Laws (Lower Priority)**
13. **Tesler's Law**: For any system, there's complexity that cannot be reduced
14. **Pareto Principle**: 80% of effects come from 20% of causes
15. **Postel's Law**: Be conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept
16. **Serial Position Effect**: Users remember first and last items best
17. **Gestalt Principles**: Whole is perceived as more than sum of parts
18. **Law of Common Region**: Elements in same region perceived as grouped
19. **Law of Similarity**: Similar elements perceived as related
20. **Law of Continuity**: Eye follows smooth paths
21. **Law of Closure**: Mind completes incomplete shapes

1. Capture timing data (start, end, duration)
2. Take screenshot before/after
3. Log UI elements present
4. Record user actions and system responses
5. Collect performance metrics (frame rate, load times)
```

#### **Step 2: Multi-Layer Analysis**
```
Layer 1: Performance Analysis
- Check Doherty Threshold (<400ms)
- Measure animation smoothness (>30fps)
- Detect loading state issues

Layer 2: Visual Analysis  
- Scan for alignment issues (pixel-perfect)

ELSE IF (secondary_workflow_issue OR visual_inconsistency_L2) THEN Craft_Orange  
ELSE IF (minor_alignment OR subtle_inconsistency_L3) THEN Craft_Yellow

Confidence Scoring:
- High (90-100%): Clear design system violation, obvious timing issue
- Medium (70-89%): Probable issue based on patterns, needs validation
- Low (50-69%): Potential issue, requires human review
```

#### **Step 4: Contextual Enhancement**
```
Persona-Specific Weighting:
- Full Stack Analysts: +20% weight to performance issues
- Super Fans: +30% weight to advanced feature bugs  
- Advanced Users: +15% weight to workflow disruptions
- Novice Users: +25% weight to clarity and basic function issues

Surface-Level Prioritization:
- L1 issues: 3x multiplier (most visible, highest impact)
- L2 issues: 2x multiplier (secondary workflows)
- L3 issues: 1x multiplier (detailed interactions)
```

### **Measurement & Validation Methods**

#### **Automated Measurements**
- **Response Time**: Millisecond precision timing for all interactions
- **Visual Consistency**: Pixel-level comparison against design specs
- **Color Compliance**: Hex code validation against Figma design tokens
- **Spacing Validation**: 8px grid alignment checking
